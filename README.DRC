x264 DRC patches
================

**NOTE** Like all our patches to standard software, this code is fragile and
not ready for production use. Use at your own risk.

* Added a new x264 param: b_drh_mode
  * Enables DRH style slicing: emit a NAL unit every 6 rows of macroblocks.

* Disables planar prediction (not working on DRC) - should be made runtime
  configurable at some point
